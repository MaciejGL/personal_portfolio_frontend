# Personal Portfolio

Providing a personal portfolio as a web developer, it's a mandatory. Therefore, I've decided to create a new one based on my current skill level. I choose to go with JAM stack to accelerate a production and have a full control of the content. This project was developed to present most recent skills and show off in details projects I have made.

## Problem & Solution:

How to make easy managable website like a blog with fast rendering and proper SEO?

Choice was simple, Gatsby with Strapi! It makes it easy to produce an webapp where You can provide dynamic content without diving into code.


## Stack Explanation
### Frontend: 
#### ```Gatsby GraphQL```
### Backend
#### ```Strapi MongoDB```

The fundamental reason why I have decided to go for this stack was mostly because I want to practise more Gatsby and use most of features they provided. Additionally I utilized the power of server side rendering.

Strapi with MongoDB provide an easy accessible content management to me. I don't need to worry about a code anymore since everything is being fetched from REST API.


## Thoughts and Future Improvements

First at all I super happily to see a nicely working web app which shows all content I desire to show. It gives me motivation to go for another iteration and continuous improvements.

The next step will be to adjust little stylings to create better user experience as well as probably enhancing app into a kind of personal Blog. For now I'll put more focus on utilizing ALL of the unique features Gatsby is providing.
